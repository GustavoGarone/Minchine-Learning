# Exercise 1
> For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical
learning method to bebetter or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

## Part a
> the sample size $n$ is extremely large, and the number of predictors $p$ is small.

In this case, we'd expect a flexible model to perform better in this case since overfitting is less of a concern with few
predictors.

## Part b
> The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations $n$ is small.

In contrast to (a), with a lot of parameters, we should use an inflexible model as to avoid overfitting.

## Part c
> The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.

With a highly non-linear relationship, we should use more flexible models as to lower the bias.

## Part d
>The variance of the error terms, i.e. $\sigma^2=\mathrm{Var}(\epsilon)$, is extremely high.

In contrast to (c), with a high variance of the error terms, we should aim at using less flexible models as highly
flexibles one might overfit to the data and it's errors.

# Exercise 2
> Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate whether we are most interested
in inference or prediction. Finally, provide $n$ and $p$.

## Part a
> We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees,
industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.

This is an inference and regression problem, as we are interested in understanding factors (inference) that affect
a numerical value (CEO's salaries). We are using data from $n=500$ companies to learn how the $p=3$ parameters (profit,
number of employees, and industry) affect CEO salary.

## Part b
> We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or afailure. We collect data
on $20$ similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or
failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.

This is a classification problem concerned with predicting whether the company will fail or not. We are using data from
$n=20$ similar products and for each of them we have $p=13$ parameters that might affect the company's outcome.

## Part c
> We are interested in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro exchange rate in relation to the weekly changes in the world
stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the % change in the USD/Euro, the %
change in the US market, the % change in the British market, and the % change in the German market.

This is a regression problem concerned with predicting a numerical (percentual) value. We have data from the $n=52$ weeks
of 2012 and $p=3$ parameters.

# Exercise 3
> We now revisit the bias-variance decomposition.

## Part a
> Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error
curves, on a single plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches.
The $x$-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the $y$-axis should represent the values
for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.

```{julia}
using Plots

# Dummy curves for representation, ignore actual form
berror(x) = 1
sbias(x) = 1/x

plot(berror, label="Sq. Bias", ylabel="Value", xlabel="Flexibility", title="Error curves sketched")
```
